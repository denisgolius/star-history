VictoriaMetrics is packed with features to help developers, DevOps/SRE engineers to work at peak efficiency.

- **High availability:** VictoriaMetrics Cluster is perfectly suited for building [high availability](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#high-availability), [scalability](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#cluster-resizing-and-scalability) and [multi-regional setups](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/guides/multi-regional-setup-dedicated-regions.html).
- **Multi-tenancy:** VictoriaMetrics Cluster supports [multiple isolated tenants](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#multitenancy) (aka namespaces). Tenants are identified by `accountID` or `accountID:projectID`, which are put inside request [urls](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Cluster-VictoriaMetrics.html#url-format).
- **Alerting support:** mechanism of alerting and recording rules execution is placed in a separate [vmalert](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmalert.html) component, which can be used with any compatible Prometheus HTTP API. For sending alerting notifications vmalert relies on Alertmanager as well as Prometheus does. Vmalert is heavily inspired by Prometheus implementation and aims to be compatible with its syntax.
- **Cross-platform:** VictoriaMetrics can be used on [any popular operating system](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/BestPractices.html#operating-system) like GNU Linux, MacOS, Windows, FreeBSD/OpenBSD and Solaris/SmartOS as well as different [arhitectures](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/BestPractices.html#supported-architectures).
- **Inspections:** VictoriaMetrics Single and Cluster has integrated [vmui](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/Single-server-VictoriaMetrics.html#vmui) which support [query tracing](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/#query-tracing) feature to help you debug your requests and correct them when you make minor mistakes when configuring [MetricsQL](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/MetricsQL.html) queries.
